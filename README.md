A module for generating the Style header for SSA/Aegisub/SubStation Alpha subtitle files.
Uses a limited object structure to determine styles which (hopefully) greatly simplifies the process of including particular attributes.

To be added:

- [ ] Tests
- [ ] 100% coverage (needed here really)
- [ ] Documentation (e.g. how the style objects work)
- [ ] Ability to add a dynamic number of styles with the names specified within
- [ ] ...possible option to include Subtitle heading too
